A quiz model is a representation of the structure and functionality of a quiz application. It defines how questions, answers, and other relevant information are organized and interact within the system. Here are key components and considerations for designing a quiz model:

Questions:

A quiz model includes a representation of questions. Each question is associated with a unique identifier.
Question content: The actual text or content of the question.
Type of question: Multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, etc.
Difficulty level: Easy, medium, or hard.
Answers:

Each question has a set of possible answers.
Correct answer(s): Indicate which answer(s) are correct.
Incorrect answers: Provide distractors for multiple-choice questions.
Quiz Structure:

Define how questions are organized in the quiz (e.g., linear sequence or random order).
Specify the number of questions in a quiz or a time limit for completing the quiz.
Scoring System:

Define how scoring is calculated. Different questions may have different point values.
Decide whether there are penalties for incorrect answers.
User Interaction:

Specify how users interact with the quiz (e.g., clicking on answers, navigating between questions).
Determine if users can go back to review and change their answers.
